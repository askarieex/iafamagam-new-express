# Period-Based Accounting System Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This implementation transforms your application from a running-balance register into a true period-based accounting system. Every balance shown to users is now anchored to the specific date they select, ensuring historically accurate validation and proper back-dated transaction handling.

## 🚀 What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Core Snapshot Service** (`backend/src/services/snapshotService.js`)
- Calculates historical balances by combining `monthly_ledger_balances` with same-month transactions
- Provides accurate balance snapshots for any date
- Handles balance propagation when back-dated transactions are saved/voided

### 2. **New API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/transactions/snapshot` - Get all ledger balances as of a specific date
- `GET /api/transactions/snapshot/ledger` - Get single ledger balance as of a specific date

### 3. **Date-First Frontend Workflow** 
- **Transaction date picker is now the FIRST control** and must be selected before anything else
- All ledger dropdowns and amount fields are disabled until date is selected
- Historical balance display shows exact figures as they were on the selected date
- Clear visual indicators distinguish historical vs current balances

### 4. **Historical Balance Validation**
- All form validation now uses historical balances instead of `current_balance`
- Users cannot debit more cash/bank than was actually available on the selected date
- Prevents impossible back-dated transactions

### 5. **Database Optimizations**
- New migration adds indexes on `transactions.tx_date` for performance
- Composite index on `account_id, tx_date` for snapshot queries

### 6. **Data Rebuild Script**
- One-time script to rebuild all historical monthly snapshots
- Ensures proper baselines before deploying the new system

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate
```

### Step 2: Rebuild Historical Data
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/rebuild-historical-snapshots.js
```

### Step 3: Deploy Backend First
Deploy the backend with the new snapshot service and endpoints.

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend
Deploy the updated frontend with the date-first workflow.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Date-First Transaction Flow
1. **User opens New Transaction form**
2. **Date picker is prominently displayed and must be selected first**
3. **Frontend calls `/api/transactions/snapshot?account_id=X&date=YYYY-MM-DD`**
4. **Snapshot service calculates balances as of 23:59 on that date**
5. **UI displays historical balances and enables other form fields**
6. **All validation uses historical figures**

### Historical Balance Calculation
```
For each ledger on date X:
1. Get monthly_ledger_balance for month(X)/year(X) 
2. Add/subtract all transaction_items where tx_date <= X and same month
3. Calculate proportional cash/bank splits
4. Return: opening, receipts-to-date, payments-to-date, closing, cash, bank
```

### Back-Dated Transaction Handling
When saving a back-dated transaction:
1. **Update the month that owns the transaction**
2. **Ripple changes forward to all subsequent months**
3. **Maintain period consistency automatically**

## 🎨 User Experience Changes

### Before (Running Balance)
- Shows current balance regardless of transaction date
- Back-dated entries could create impossible scenarios
- No historical context for validation

### After (Period-Based)
- **Date must be selected first** (enforced by UI)
- Shows exact historical balance for selected date
- Prevents impossible back-dated transactions
- Clear historical context with visual indicators

## 🔍 Key Features

### Visual Indicators
- **Blue-themed date picker** with "(Select First)" guidance
- **Historical balance warnings** for back-dated transactions
- **Loading states** for snapshot retrieval
- **Disabled state styling** for dependent fields

### Error Prevention
- Cannot select ledgers until date is chosen
- Cannot enter amounts until date is chosen
- Validation uses historical balances
- Clear error messages guide users

### Performance
- Indexes on transaction date for fast historical queries
- Efficient snapshot calculation using existing monthly data
- Fallback to current balances for today's date

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Scenario 1: Current Date Transaction
1. Open new transaction form
2. Today's date should be pre-selected
3. Select account → should load current balances
4. Everything should work as before

### Test Scenario 2: Back-Dated Transaction
1. Open new transaction form
2. Select a past date (e.g., last month)
3. Select account → should show historical balances
4. Balances should be different from current balances
5. Validation should use historical figures

### Test Scenario 3: Date-First Enforcement
1. Open new transaction form
2. Try to select ledger before date → should be disabled
3. Try to enter amount before date → should be disabled
4. Select date first → everything should enable

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required.

### Database
- Requires existing `monthly_ledger_balances` table
- New indexes improve query performance
- Rebuild script ensures data consistency

## 📈 Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Indexed date queries are fast
- **Positive**: Uses existing monthly snapshot data
- **Minimal**: Additional API calls only when date changes
- **Cached**: Historical balances cached per form session

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Deployment Order
1. **Deploy backend first** (contains new endpoints)
2. **Run rebuild script** (ensures data consistency) 
3. **Deploy frontend** (uses new endpoints)

### Data Consistency
- Run the rebuild script before go-live
- Ensures all historical periods have proper baselines
- One-time operation that processes all existing data

### User Training
- Users must select date first (enforced by UI)
- Historical balance context is clearly shown
- Back-dated transactions now properly validated

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

✅ **True period-based accounting** instead of running balances  
✅ **Historically accurate validation** for all transactions  
✅ **Impossible back-dated transactions prevented**  
✅ **Professional accounting software behavior**  
✅ **Date-first workflow enforced by UI**  
✅ **Balance propagation maintains period consistency**  
✅ **Visual clarity** between historical and current balances  

Your accounting system now behaves exactly like professional accounting software, with every balance anchored to the selected date and proper historical validation throughout.
